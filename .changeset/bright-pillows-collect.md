To take advantage of all of the SurveyJS features, we have re-written the survey plugin so that it now takes a SurveyJS-compatible JSON string ('survey_json') and/or a SurveyJS-compatible function ('survey_function') that manipulates a SurveyJS model. This is a breaking change. See the jsPsych Survey Plugin page for documentation and examples: https://www.jspsych.org/latest/plugins/survey/. More details about creating the SurveyJS JSON strings and functions can be found on their website: https://surveyjs.io/form-library/documentation/design-survey/create-a-simple-survey#create-a-survey-model.
